  ## Description 
  
  I created an mock E-Commerce Backend using Nodejs and Sequelize.

  Everything is modularized and contained within its own folder and file.

  I created two GET routes, a POST, PUT and DELETE for every table.

  This application is fully functional but is completely missing a front-end.

  Because of that, to perform a Get, Post, Put or Delete you will need to use Insomnia or PostMan.
